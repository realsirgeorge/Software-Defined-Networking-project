Identified Vulnerabilities:

Layer-3 Routing Application:

The Layer-3 Routing Application reveals a vulnerability stemming from a lack of input validation. This deficiency in the application's design leaves it susceptible to potential threats, particularly malicious OpenFlow messages. Without adequate validation, there is a risk of unauthorized or malicious input compromising the integrity of the application. To address this vulnerability, it is essential to implement a robust input validation mechanism within the OpenFlow message processing component. By doing so, the application can effectively filter and sanitize incoming messages, thereby enhancing security and mitigating potential threats.


Distributed Load Balancer App:

The Distributed Load Balancer App exhibits a vulnerability related to its failover handling mechanisms. During instances of path failures, the load balancer's current behavior may be suboptimal, leading to increased latency or packet loss. To bolster the resilience of the load balancer, it is imperative to enhance failover mechanisms. This involves ensuring the seamless redirection of traffic to alternative paths in the event of a failure. Additionally, implementing faster detection and recovery procedures for path failures will contribute to more efficient handling, minimizing disruptions and optimizing the load balancing process.
