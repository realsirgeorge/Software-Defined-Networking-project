Part 3 Testing and Debugging (Layer 3 Routing)

Tested connectivity on various Mininet topologies
linear,3
tree,2
triangle
mesh,5
Verified ping and TCP connectivity between every host pair
Used tcpdump on hosts to capture and inspect forwarded packets
Confirmed shortest path rules installed by inspecting flow tables with ovs-ofctl dump-flows
Tested failure recovery by shutting down links and verifying convergence


Part 4 Testing and Debugging (Load Balancer)

Configured multiple virtual IPs and back-end servers
Generated TCP traffic to virtual IPs with curl from different hosts
Verified new connections are load balanced across back-end servers
Captured and analyzed packets with tcpdump to validate address rewriting
Inserted temporary counters in code to validate balanced distribution
Confirmed no disruption to existing connections when a server is removed
Tested ARP handling by sending arp requests from hosts for virtual IPs
Validated idle connection timeout leading to TCP Resets
Debugged issues with unexpected packet forwarding using print statements and flow dumps
